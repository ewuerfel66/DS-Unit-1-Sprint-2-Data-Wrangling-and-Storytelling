## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

### Idea One: News Sources

**1. Geographic Variation

Compare demographics of the US, maybe display them geographically.

**2. Trend related to the news

Where do people get their news from? Compare views for different news sources.

**3. Who does that?

A demographic breakdown of the median viewer for different news sources.

**4. Answering a question people care about

What is fake news?

**5. Valuable to businesses

Demographics of different sources viewers is relevant for advertising.

**6. What's the most popular?

Which news sources get the most traffic? 

**7. Cost/Money rankings

Which news source makes the most from advertising? Ads vs. Subscription Revenue by Source.

### Idea Two: Finding Places to Live

**1. Geographic Variation

Select places you're willing to relocate to. Perhaps make a program that selects large cities within
a certain time's drive of a location.

**2. Trend related to the news

Housing prices skyrocketing in places like San Francisco.

**3. Who does that?

Demographics of people who live in large cities. Geographic distribution of data scientists.

**4. Answering a question people care about

What are the best places for data scientists to live?

**5. Valuable to businesses

Where are attractive places to set up offices.

**6. What's the most popular?

What's the most popular large city for data scientists?

**7. Cost/Money rankings

What are the most cost effective places to live? Is remote work worth it?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

### Idea One: News Sources

I think a lot of people still think Cable News is a lot bigger than it actually is.

### Idea Two: Finding Places to Live

There are a lot of mid sized cities that have good-paying jobs for data scientists.
I'm not exactly sure what working remotely would be like and if it would be worth it. Would
I be able to live in a cheap place and save a lot on housing and CoL.

## Examples

### Idea One: News Sources

**What data storytelling example inspires you?

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-2020-candidates-are-more-or-less-popular-than-they-should-be/

**Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Yes, I could do which News Sources are more popular than they should be.
The author used a scatterplot with 'favorability' as a function of 'share of dems with an opinion'
to see if Candidates were more or less popular than they should be.
I can do a similar analysis with 'ad revenue' and 'viewership', to see if advertisers are overestimating
the viewership of certain sources.

**Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

I wouldn't be much interested in looking too closely into the primaries, the methods just seemed intriguing.

**Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Yes, the author also did an analysis of popularity through time. I like the styl of showing a snapshot of
'now' then showing the time evolution of the system.

### Idea Two: Places to Live

**What data storytelling example inspires you?

https://priceonomics.com/where-home-prices-are-rising-the-fastest-slowest/

**Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

I could do the same question for rent prices. I didn't consider the trajectory of rent prices in
major cities before stumbling on this article.

**Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

I could also look into the median home price in large cities then map that to a typical downpayment.

**Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

The style of this article was a bit bland. I'd like to cover a little more ground and tell more of a story.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

### Idea One: News Sources

There are cable news ratings published on https://www.adweek.com/ that I could scrape.
I may have to look for an alternative source because I might hit a paywall.

https://socialblade.com/ has data on alternative media accounts that I could get.

### Idea Two: Finding Places to Live

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ has good economic data for the US.

I could scrape rent prices for one bedroom apartments on a popular apartment website.

The source mentioned that Zillow aggregates and publishes home price data.
They might do this for rent data as well.

## Contrast

I'm leaning towards **Idea Two: Finding Places to Live**. This is a really pertinent question to me,
and I think I could find a lot of useful information to make a more informed decision on where I'd like to
find a job, and buy my first home.

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
