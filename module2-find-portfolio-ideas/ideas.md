## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

### Idea One: News Sources

1. Geographic Variation

Compare demographics of the US, maybe display them geographically.

2. Trend related to the news

Where do people get their news from? Compare views for different news sources.

3. Who does that?

A demographic breakdown of the median viewer for different news sources.

4. Answering a question people care about

What is fake news?

5. Valuable to businesses

Demographics of different sources viewers is relevant for advertising.

6. What's the most popular?

Which news sources get the most traffic? 

7. Cost/Money rankings

Which news source makes the most from advertising? Ads vs. Subscription Revenue by Source.

### Idea Two: Finding Places to Live

1. Geographic Variation

Select places you're willing to relocate to. Perhaps make a program that selects large cities within
a certain time's drive of a location.

2. Trend related to the news

Housing prices skyrocketing in places like San Francisco.

3. Who does that?

Demographics of people who live in large cities. Geographic distribution of data scientists.

4. Answering a question people care about

What are the best places for data scientists to live?

5. Valuable to businesses

Where are attractive places to set up offices.

6. What's the most popular?

What's the most popular large city for data scientists?

7. Cost/Money rankings

What are the most cost effective places to live? Is remote work worth it?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

### Idea One: News Sources

I think a lot of people still think Cable News is a lot bigger than it actually is.

### Idea Two: Finding Places to Live

There are a lot of mid sized cities that have good-paying jobs for data scientists.
I'm not exactly sure what working remotely would be like and if it would be worth it. Would
I be able to live in a cheap place and save a lot on housing and CoL.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?



Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

### Idea One: News Sources

There are cable news ratings published on https://www.adweek.com/ that I could scrape.
I may have to look for an alternative source because I might hit a paywall.

https://socialblade.com/ has data on alternative media accounts that I could get.

### Idea Two: Finding Places to Live

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ has good economic data for the US.

I could scrape rent prices for one bedroom apartments on a popular apartment website.
